I was really bored so I made a file sharing service which uses AES GCM. It was actually very challenging to get working as this was the first project I have personally worked on where being careful with memory usage was extremely important (Go's AES GCM implementation requires a buffer to be in memory to encrypt/decrypt).

Files get deleted after one hour by a cron job, if you want to play with it. Currently I've implemented the local file system as the only mechanism of storage, but I plan to add Amazon S3 support soon (I will be making use of DigitalOcean spaces).

I plan to turn Dump Me into a larger project but I ended up just making this basic demo because why not. I learned from it that this isn't end to end encryption, and if I want that I'll have to encrypt on the client. Encrypting/decrypting on the server has several obvious attack vectors (RAM leaking, stealing temporary files), but it's better than always having all unencrypted data.
